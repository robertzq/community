## How does this map work?

No big deal: GitHub allows to generate static websites out of repositories. They make use of [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), a ruby based generator. Jekyll comes with [Liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/) templates, which helped us to inject all our map entries within a JSON at the bottom of the HTML. JavaScript grabs the data and starts a nice [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com) map with beautiful tiles provided by [CARTO](https://carto.com/location-data-services/basemaps/).  
â€”Well, thatâ€™s it. Â¯\\\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯
